This project is based on bthidd, developed by Maksim Yevmenkin 
<m_evmenkin@yahoo.com>, and information from http://www.wiili.org

The usage is very similar to bthidd.

To install the program:

make clean
make
make install

To make it work:

1. hccontrol -n ubt0hci inquiry
2. bthidcontrol -a BD_ADDR query >> /usr/local/etc/bsdmoted.conf
3. bsdmoted

Then you should be able to use wii remote as a mouse. 

Current default setting is using IR pointing sensor on movement
control, default left button is button A, right button is button B.
You can change movement method as IR pointing with -m 1 or touch 
button 1. You can change movement method as tilting with -m 2 or touch
button 2. A non-well defined calibration is also made when setting
movement method.

According to 

http://www.cns.bu.edu/~chhsiao/bsdmoted/gimp.mpg

The IR pointing works well.

Currently conflicts with bthidd (Bind to same bluetooth address.)

Pointing sensor with sensor bar will be available in next version.
